# Exploit Development Notes | r0r0x_xx

Hey everyone,

In this post, I am going to explain to you some of the basics about fuzzing, shellcode and some different techniques of developing attacks and exploits using Vulnserver that have personally helped me a lot in my training process to take the OSCE certification exam.

Vulnserver is a Windows-based, threaded TCP server application that is designed to be exploited. The program is intended to be used as a learning tool to teach about the software exploitation process.

## List of materials needed to create the practice lab

- OS GNU/Linux with python 3
- Windows machine
- Immunity Debugger
- Corelan - mona.py
- Boofuzz

## Laboratory configuration and virtual machines.
